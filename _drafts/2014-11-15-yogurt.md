	We've been using our <a href="{{ site.url }}//2014/05/22/sous-vide-PID/">Sous-Vide temperature controller</a> a lot lately to make yogurt, and it has attracted the curiosity of our roommates and colleagues. To make it more user friendly and easier to build, I tried to design a more finished product with easily sourceable parts.

	The model can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:224822" target="_blank">the Thingiverse</a>. I first looked for the blueprints and found them on a <a href="http://www.avions-piel.com/cp320-super-emeraude/topic6.html" target="_blank">french forum</a> dedicated to these little airplanes.

	I also worked on adding a timer and simplifying the menus to that the PID parameter tunings are placed in an "Advanced settings" submenu. Here's the menu structure now.

	The Arduino code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/naimo/Arduino---Crockpot-thermostat/tree/master/SousVideTimer" target="blank">Github page</a>, and should work as long as the same temperature sensor and type of LCD are used and the pin numbers are adjusted.
