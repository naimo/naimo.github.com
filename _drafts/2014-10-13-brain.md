	As part of her research at the Kavli Institute for Brain and Mind at UC San Diego, in the <a href="http://greenspanlab.ucsd.edu/">research laboratory of Prof. Ralph Greenspan</a>, my sister uses advanced microscopy techniques to observe the activity of the brain of the fruit fly (Drosophila Melanogaster) in three dimensions. 3D data isn't trivial to display on a conventional 2D screen like a computer monitor, so I started thinking about ways to show it on a real model.

	At the same time, the MIT department where I currently do research (Materials Science and Engineering) acquired a Formlabs 3D printer, which has a great print resolution and allows to make models in a transparent resin. After several design iterations, I decided to use optical fibers to light up a 3D printed model in specific locations.

	I downloaded the model from..the first thing was to clean up the mesh and remove inner voids to facilitate the printing.

	To determine the location where the optical fiber should end, I created a grid of spheres with 3mm radius and fixed spacing, then deleted all
