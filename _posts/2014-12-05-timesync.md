title: Time synchronization between android devices

<div class="well">
	<p>
		As part of a larger android project, I need to be able to synchronize the clocks between android devices connected to the same wifi network, with an accuracy of a few milliseconds. After doing some reading on NTP (network time protocols), I decided to use a simple round-trip udp exchange of time stamps, illustrated below.

		</div>
	</div>

	<p>
		The calculation of the offset (variable "o") assumes that the delay (variable "d") is the same in either direction. The message from the server to the client contains the time stamps "t<sub>2</sub>" and "t<sub>3</sub>" so that the client can do the calculation.
	</p>

</div>

<p>
	I want both devices to be able to either request a time offset or provide one, so I run a server thread that listens on a predefined port for incoming udp packets.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
public class UdpServerThread extends Thread {

	DatagramSocket socket;

	@Override
	public void run() {
		try {
			socket = new DatagramSocket(SERVERPORT);

			// keep listening
			while (true) {
				// receive client packet
				byte[] buf = new byte[16];
				DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length);
				socket.receive(packet);
				long serverreceive = System.currentTimeMillis();

				// get client address:port
				InetAddress clientAddress = packet.getAddress();
				int port = packet.getPort();

				// send server time stamps
				long serversend = System.currentTimeMillis();
				byte[] sendbuf = ByteBuffer.allocate(24)
						.putLong(serverreceive).putLong(serversend).array();
				packet = new DatagramPacket(sendbuf, sendbuf.length,
						clientAddress, port);
				socket.send(packet);
			}

		} catch (Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
			Log.d("server", "Error!");
		}
	}
}
</pre>

<p>
	The client thread initializes the exchange with the server and waits for the server response which contains the server receiving and sending time stamps. There is noise in the measurement depending on the network and how busy the devices are, so I get 10 measurements and take a median value. The noise on the filtered values of the clock offset is about one millisecond, and

	The client initializes the exchange with the server and waits for the server response which contains the server receiving and sending time stamps. There is noise in the measurement depending on the network and how busy the devices are, so I get 10 measurements of the offset and take a median value. The noise on the filtered values is about one millisecond, so I get very consistent values. The question that remains is: is this offset accurate.
</p>

	To try to answer this question, I use this process to synchronize the blinking of some text on three devices and record it at 240fps to estimate the error. There is some error in the synchronization by up to 12ms, however the blinking order among the devices is not consistent (the device that blinks first isn't always the same), so it is hard to know what is the actual accuracy of the offset measurement. Because the blinking order is quite random, I actually think that the offset calculation accuracy is much better than those 12ms. The video is played at 1/8x real speed.
