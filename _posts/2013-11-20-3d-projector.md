	When the backlight of an old laptop of mine died, I looked into projects that could repurpose and salvage its LCD screen. I quickly found myself absorbed in the realm of DIY projectors, and in particular in the LumenLab Forum, which was one of the best resources out there on the subject at the time. The forum is now dead, however, fortunately, most of the content can still be accessed via the Wayback Machine which has an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120309041922/http://www.lumenlab.com/forums/index.php?showforum=29">archive of the old posts</a>. There are a couple other good resources out there, and, in particular, a very good french forum named <a href="www.allinbox.com">Allinbox</a>.

	The main idea behind these DIY projectors is to strip the LCD screen of an old laptop or external monitor, place a very bright lamp on one side, add a few optics, lenses and mirrors to project the image on a wall or projection screen. Thanks to the work and optimization of hundreds of passionate DIYers, these homemade projectors can result in a higher quality image than some of their commercial counterparts at a lower cost.

	Because I really like 3D movies, I looked into the posibility of tweaking these projector designs and make one that is stereo-capable. In late 2012, A number of months later and after much deliberation, I started going to the shop and gave it a try. I'll try to summarize my journey in this post. For more details on the fabrication, please visit my <a href="">Instructable</a>.

To make things reasonably simple, the project revolves around the idea of reusing the usual linear polarized 3D glasses such as the ones used in IMAX 3D cinemas. These are based on the filtering of polarized light to assign the right image to the right eye. What is needed is a way to project two superimposed images, polarized in perpendicular directions, from a single LCD screen. Here's a side view picture showing how the two images have to overlap.

Here's a more detailed view of the inside of the projector and how the light travels from the lamp, through the two halves of the LCD screen, through various lenses and finally through the two projection lenses which are positioned such that the projected images overlap exactly on the screen. It is largely based on the usual design of a DIY projector, as found in projects of the forums that I mentioned, except for the part that takes care of projecting the two different halves of the LCD. All the dimensions are calculated thanks to my little <a href="{{ site.url }}/projector/">Mathematica script</a> in which one can play with the various specifications and dimensions of the LCD, lenses, etc.
