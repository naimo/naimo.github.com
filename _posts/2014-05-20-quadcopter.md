		As a gift to myself for finishing grad school, I ordered all the parts I needed to make a quadcopter. Inspired by the amazing videos by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAMZOHjmiInGYjOplGhU38g">TeamBlackSheep</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC16hCs7XeniFuoJq0hm_-EA">David Windest√•l</a> and others, the long term goal is to make a compact quad capable of transmitting video from an on-board camera in real time, and be piloted in first-person-view (FPV). I love the idea of goint to visit places inaccessible otherwise, of course without putting other in danger or invading their privacy.

	Right now, I've got a flying quad, and I received a GoPro camera as a gift which I mounted on it and let me record the following video. For now I'm piloting in line-of-sight, but I'll make another post when I get FPV gear and have it setup.</p>

	Here's the bill of materials I needed to get flying.
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="http://www.hobbyking.com/">HobbyKing</a> Q450 V3 frame</li>
	  <li><a href="http://rctimer.com/">RC-timer</a> HP2212 1000kv motors (4x)</li>
	  <li><a href="http://www.hobbyking.com/">HobbyKing</a> Blueseries 30A Electronic Speed Controller (4x)</li>
	  <li><a href="http://www.hobbyking.com/">HobbyKing</a> 8x4.5 slow flight propellers (4x)</li>
	  <li><a href="http://www.hobbyking.com/">HobbyKing</a> Multiwii 328p flight controller and Bluetooth module</li>
	  	  <li><a href="http://www.hobbyking.com/">HobbyKing</a> Zippy Flightmax 4S 30C 5000mAh and 2800mAh LiPo batteries</li>
	  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> Integy C23212 Lipo Voltage Checker/Warning Buzzer</li>
	  <li><a href="http://www.hobbyking.com/">HobbyKing</a> Turnigy Accucel-6 battery charger</li>
	  <li><a href="http://www.hobbyking.com/">HobbyKing</a> Turnigy 9X Radio Transmitter and Receiver</li>
	  <li><a href="http://www.hobbyking.com/">HobbyKing</a> 1500mAh LiFe transmitter battery</li>
	</ul>
</p>

	Putting it together was quite simple, it's really like a DJI Flamewheel 450 kit, except with cheaper components, and there are tons of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSCvCAC7Q-c">videos</a> and <a href="http://download.dji-innovations.com/downloads/flamewheel/en/F450_User_Manual_v2.1_en.pdf">manuals</a> around the web. It's quite amazing to see it fly after only a couple hours spent on building it.

	You'll notice that the top plate looks quite different from the other components, it's because I broke the original fiberglass plate in a crash and I had to cut a new one in an aluminum sheet. It's so convenient to have access to a waterjet, I quickly designed a replacement and the quad was flying again the next day ! I uploaded the files on the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:333932">Thingiverse</a>.

			To fix some issues with the stability of the quad, I had to flash the electronic speed controllers with a new firmware (latest SimonK hex file). It really improved the performance, the high pitch hissing noise that I used to hear disappeared completely, leaving only the melodious humming of the propellers (my understanding is that the new firmware uses a higher frequency pulsed width modulation, outside of the audible range). I used the usual USBavr programmer and followed these <a href="http://polakiumengineering.org/?p=1119">instructions for wiring</a>. I flashed with the <a href="http://lazyzero.de/en/modellbau/kkmulticopterflashtool">KKMulticopter Flashtool</a>.
