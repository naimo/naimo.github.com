		We have had the chance to live for two years in an apartment with an amazing terrace.

	Here is what the lamp actually looks like when it is in use. There is a spherical reflector at the back and a lens at the front, that maximize the amount of light actually passing through the LCD and reaching the projection screen. The 1/4" aluminum parts that hold everything together were cut in the waterjet. The lamp is a 400W metal halide bulb, which produces a lot of heat, thus the two fans at the back of the box which continuously extract the hot air while around the lamp while cool air comes in the box from a side aperture, close to the LCD.

	I used pretty rudimentary mounts, that I cut in wood scraps, to secure the fresnel (large and flat) lenses and LCD in place. There is also a sheet of polycarbonate (Lexan) between the lamp and the first fresnel lens that acts as a heat shield to protect the other components from overheating.

	The two objective lenses, whose final position is critical to obtain superposition of the two images on the screen, are mounted on small plywood panels that can be moved around thanks to a sliding mechanism. This is to compensate for the fabrication inaccuracies when cutting the lenses and mounting the LCD. It allows to move the projected image around to a certain extent, as long as all of the light coming from the LCD passes through the objective lenses.

	The laptop is mounted inside the box, and will be used to control the LCD screen, store the 3D movies and play them. A cable was hooked up to its power button to allow to turn it on and off without having to access it.
