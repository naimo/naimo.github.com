	My parents are pilots, and they own a little 2-seater airplane, designed by a french company called Avions Piel. For a christmas gift, I thought I would make a little model of their plane, so I asked a friend (thanks Chris!) to show me how to use Rhino to make a 3D model of a real object. It was then printed on a Dimension BST 1200 ES 3D printer, in the DMSE department at MIT.

	The model can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:224822" target="_blank">the Thingiverse</a>. I first looked for the blueprints and found them on a <a href="http://www.avions-piel.com/cp320-super-emeraude/topic6.html" target="_blank">french forum</a> dedicated to these little airplanes.
