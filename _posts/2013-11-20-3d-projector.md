When the backlight of an old laptop of mine died, I looked into projects that could repurpose and salvage its LCD screen. I quickly found myself absorbed in the realm of DIY projectors, and in particular in the LumenLab Forum, which was one of the best resources out there on the subject at the time. The forum is now dead but, fortunately, most of the content can still be accessed via the Wayback Machine which has an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120309041922/http://www.lumenlab.com/forums/index.php?showforum=29">archive of the old posts</a>. There are a couple other good resources out there, and, in particular, a french forum that is still live named <a href="www.allinbox.com">Allinbox</a>.

The main idea behind these DIY projectors is to strip the LCD screen of an old laptop or external monitor, place a very bright lamp on one side, add a few optics, lenses and mirrors to project the image on a wall or projection screen. Thanks to the work and optimization of hundreds of passionate DIYers, these homemade projectors have nothing to be jealous of, when compared to their commercial counterparts. In fact, for a long time, these would often result in a higher quality image at a lower cost, provided you started with a high quality LCD screen. Because I really like 3D movies, I looked into the posibility of tweaking these projector designs and make one that is stereo-capable. In late 2012, A number of months later and after much deliberation, I started going to the shop and gave it a try. I'll try to summarize my journey in this post.

To make things simple, I started revolving around the idea of reusing regular linear polarized 3D glasses such as the ones used in IMAX 3D. These are based on the filtering of polarized light to assign the right image to the right eye. What I needed was a way to project two superimposed images, polarized in perpendicular directions, from a single LCD screen. Here's a picture showing how the two images should overlap.
