When the backlight of an old laptop of mine died, I looked into projects that could repurpose and salvage its LCD screen. I quickly narrowed down to the realm of DIY projectors, and in particular on the LumenLab Forum, which was one of the best resources out there on the subject. The forum is now dead, but, fortunately, most of the content can still be accessed via the Wayback Machine which has an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120309041922/http://www.lumenlab.com/forums/index.php?showforum=29">archive of the old posts</a>. There are a couple other good resources out there, and, in particular, a french Forum that is still live named <a href="www.allinbox.com">Allinbox</a>.
