		As a gift to myself for finishing grad school, I ordered all the parts I needed to make a quadcopter. Inspired by the amazing videos by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAMZOHjmiInGYjOplGhU38g" target="_blank">TeamBlackSheep</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC16hCs7XeniFuoJq0hm_-EA" target="_blank">David Windest√•l</a> and others, the long term goal is to make a compact quad capable of transmitting video from an on-board camera in real time, and be piloted in first-person-view (FPV). I love the idea of goint to visit places otherwise inaccessible.

	After some initial tuning, I've got a flying quad ! Mounting a GoPro camera on it let me record the following video. I'm piloting both in line-of-sight and in FPV (first person view), which means transmitting the live video from the on board camera to LCD goggles.

	Here's the bill of materials I needed to get flying.
	<ul>

	  <li><a href="http://rctimer.com/" target="_blank">RC-timer</a> HP2212 1000kv motors (4x)</li>

	</ul>

	Putting it together was quite simple, it's really like a DJI Flamewheel 450 kit, except with cheaper components, and there are tons of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSCvCAC7Q-c" target="_blank">videos</a> and <a href="http://download.dji-innovations.com/downloads/flamewheel/en/F450_User_Manual_v2.1_en.pdf" target="_blank">manuals</a> around the web. It's quite amazing to see it fly after only a couple hours spent on building it.

	You'll notice that the top plate looks quite different from the other components, it's because I broke the original fiberglass plate in a crash and I had to cut a new one in an aluminum sheet. It's so convenient to have access to a waterjet, I quickly designed a replacement and the quad was flying again the next day ! I uploaded the files on the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:333932" target="_blank">Thingiverse</a>.

			To fix some issues with the stability of the quad, I also had to flash the electronic speed controllers with a new firmware (latest SimonK hex file). It really improved the performance, the high pitch hissing noise that I used to hear disappeared completely, leaving only the melodious humming of the propellers (my understanding is that the new firmware uses a higher frequency pulsed width modulation, outside of the audible range). I used the usual USBavr programmer and followed these <a href="http://polakiumengineering.org/?p=1119" target="_blank">instructions for wiring</a>. I flashed with the <a href="http://lazyzero.de/en/modellbau/kkmulticopterflashtool" target="_blank">KKMulticopter Flashtool</a>.
